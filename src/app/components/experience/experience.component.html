    <h1>My Journey in Tech</h1>

    <p>“I have always been passionate about technology. My journey began with Android development, where I spent six years building and optimizing mobile applications. One of my most exciting projects was the <strong>Rizzle short video mobile app</strong> and its <strong>web version</strong>. Seeing people create and engage with short videos on a platform I helped build was truly rewarding.”</p>

    <p>“After that, I worked on <strong>Android Ama App</strong>, exploring new ways to enhance user experience. Then came <strong>Fishwrap</strong> and <strong>Fashionwrap</strong>, where I blended content, fashion, and technology. Each project pushed me to think differently and solve unique challenges.”</p>

    <p>“As I progressed, I moved into backend development and spent six years mastering <strong>Node.js</strong>. I worked with <strong>Redis, AWS, Kafka, GraphQL, ElasticSearch</strong>, and many other technologies. I integrated <strong>Stripe for payments</strong>, set up <strong>AWS services for email and SMS</strong>, and even used <strong>OpenAI for summarization</strong>. Every project taught me something new.”</p>

    <p>“Beyond coding, I stepped into leadership roles. I started mentoring developers, setting up <strong>CI/CD pipelines</strong>, and ensuring high-quality code. Managing a team is not just about writing clean code—it’s about guiding people, solving problems, and driving efficiency.”</p>

    <p>“Recently, I joined <strong>OpenText</strong> as a <strong>Lead Software Engineer</strong> for the <strong>LoadRunner team</strong>. Now, I work at the intersection of <strong>AI and backend engineering</strong>, making architectural decisions and leading teams.”</p>

    <p>“The journey hasn’t always been easy. I’ve faced <strong>tight deadlines, production issues, and even self-doubt</strong>. I struggled with <strong>stage fear in meetings</strong> and felt pressure in new leadership roles. But I pushed myself, learning step by step. Today, I’m more confident in public speaking and decision-making than ever before.”</p>

    <p>“On the financial side, I’ve planned well. I have a strategy involving <strong>mutual funds, fixed deposits, and real estate</strong>, ensuring a secure future for my family. Balancing work, life, and financial goals has been a key part of my success.”</p>

    <p>“Looking ahead, I know there’s so much more to achieve. I’m excited to take on new challenges, solve bigger problems, and continue growing in the
